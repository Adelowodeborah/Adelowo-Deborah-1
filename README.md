# INTRODUCTION
In this data analysis report, I shall analyze some Mexican restaurants and their customers.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT/RECOMMENDED ANALYSIS
## Question 1.
What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on
ratings? 
## Question 2.
What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?
## Question 3.
Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?
## Question 4.
If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?

Three restaurants have achieved the top position by getting the highest average rating i.e Emillianos, Michiko Restaurant Japones and Restaurant Las Mafianitas.They all have an average overall rating of 2 other restaurants have poor ratings.

Most customers prefer Mexican cuisine but at the top right table, the top restaurants are not dominated by Mexican cuisine.
So,there is no strong impact of consumer preference on rating.

From the bottom right pie chart, the city San Luis Potosi has the maximum number of consumers and the city Jiutepec has the lowest number of consumers. There is surely bias in the data sample because each city has a different size of data in the sample i.e there is one with small data size and another with large data size.

There is a demand and supply gap because from the visual above lots of consumers prefer Mexican cuisine 
but there are not enough restaurants to cater their demand.

# Recommendations
To invest in a restaurant business, the following things will be considered to make more profit ðŸ˜„

More restaurants shall be opened in San Luis Potosi because it has the highest consumer by state.

My restaurant should be opened in a location that is easily accessible by public transport.

The restaurant shall be priortized for the unmarried people.

I shall give the most importance to the consumers who are 20 years of old.

More meals for the students will be introduced and also make it medium budget.
